.lst

    List file. I just don't like using text files.


.commit

    File containing a commit. Uses the following format:

        <filename>
        <modification_type>;<start_line>;<line_count>;<special_delim><affected_code><reversed_special_delim>
            ...
        
        ...


        Where:

            <filename>: name of file affected by commit
            <modification_type>: in, del, or mod
            <start_line>: line num of start to modification
            <line_count>: length of modification
            <special_delim>: typically "~/". To signal the start and end of the code block. If "~/" is in the
                             code block, it becomes "~//" or "~///", etc.
            <affected_code>: block of code that was deleted or modified. No need to specify for insertion.
            <reversed_special_delim>: special_delim reversed. Typically "/~"
