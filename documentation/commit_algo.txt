Find all the lines of the current code in the previous code
Map the spaced in between as either insertions or deletions
Add all to list
For commit comparisons, would need to invert all of the insertions and deletions
Create a hash table containing all the lines of code for easy search to determine if they are all in table
Save hash tables to file for easy re-creation once it comes time to load up this commit again to compare to new code
