The node will contain a single FileLine object
the node will have a pop method that will recursively search for the value
The node will call the the pop method of the FileLine object when it finds it

the FileLine object will overload the comparison operator to be the value
the FileLine object will have a pop method with a variant bool/FileLine return value. False for don't preserve, or FileLine object
the FileLine objects pop method will return a FileLine object
given duplicates, the FileLine pop return will be a copy of it's own object with the same text value, but only 1 line num

in the pop recursion, the parent node of the found value node will delete it if the pop P.B.R. bool comes up true
the node pop func will also have a return value of FileLine (from the FileLine obj) and a bool P.B.R. (True if value found)

the hash table will have a pop method with a P.B.R. bool and a FileLine obj return value
